# Migration Monolith CMS to a Headless-based approach.
As digital products continue to evolve, so does the content we consume. A scalable, cross-platform content management system is crucial to ensuring a product’s growth velocity. Traditional CMS gives the comfort of having the content, the editing interface, templates and custom codes, in a single environment. But with the changes in this mobile and IoT era, and need for multi-channels that’s no longer enough.

We need a new breed of CMS, one that can make content available through any channel at which point a Headless CMS is required. A headless CMS gives you the benefits of managing the content and delivering it to any channel. The API makes content available through any channel and on any device using most favourite tools and programming languages, plus it also provides a higher level of security and much better scalability.

Headless CMS comes with an API-friendly approach, which makes it possible to publish content through an API (either RESTful or GraphQL). In our case we will be using GraphQL - which evolves, lean and provides less redundancy. It allows us to use the same API to connect to different data systems/end points parallely and deliver content across various channels such as Android or IOS apps, smartwatches, AR/VR, etc.

With a traditional CMS, changes can be time-consuming, for example, to tweak a part of your site, you need to re-implement the entire CMS. With a headless CMS, you can make changes to your front end without having any impact on the back-end infrastructure, hence saving time and resources, which makes it much better.

Migration will involve transferring content, including rich text, images, videos, and other media, content in page builders and widgets, personalization and variation content from the old CMS to the new one.
